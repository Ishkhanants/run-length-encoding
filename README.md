# run-length-encoding
Run-length encoding (RLE) is a form of lossless data compression in which runs of data (sequences in which the same data value occurs in many consecutive data elements) are stored as a single data value and count, rather than as the original run. Implemented run length encoding and decoding (3rd course, 1st semester)
